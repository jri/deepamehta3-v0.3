DeepaMehta 3
============

DeepaMehta is a platform for collaboration and knowledge management.  
DeepaMehta 3 is a AJAX-driven web application based on CouchDB, Lucene, and HTML 5 Canvas.  
DeepaMehta 3 will become a complete rewrite of DeepaMehta 2 (which is Java-based).

    <http://github.com/rnewson/couchdb-lucene/tree/v0.4>

        sudo -u couchdb couchdb
