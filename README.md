Installation
------------

### Preparation ###

1.  Install Python, Java, Git

2.  Install CouchDB

3.  Install CouchApp

    ** Please note:** DeepaMehta 3 has only been tested with CouchApp versions 0.3.2 to 0.3.32 so far.  
    When using the newer CouchApp versions 0.3.4 or 0.4 the DeepaMehta 3 installation procedure might differ from described here.

4.  Install couchdb-lucene

    ** Please note:** Do not install the couchdb-lucene trunk (which is 0.5 in progress and unstable).  
    Instead download the latest stable version, which is 0.4, from here:  
    <http://cloud.github.com/downloads/rnewson/couchdb-lucene/couchdb-lucene-0.4-jar-with-dependencies.jar.gz>

    IMPORTANT: Follow this unpack instruction (the usual `gunzip` won't work!):  
    <http://cloud.github.com/downloads/rnewson/couchdb-lucene/README>

5.  Configure CouchDB for use with couchdb-lucene as described in the couchdb-lucene README for version 0.4:  
    <http://github.com/rnewson/couchdb-lucene/tree/v0.4>

    (You also get there from the project's main page <http://github.com/rnewson/couchdb-lucene/> by choosing `v0.4` from the `all tags` menu.)

6.  Start CouchDB server
        sudo -u couchdb couchdb

### DeepaMehta 3 installation ###

1.  Go to the directory where you like to install DeepaMehta 3, e.g.:
        cd /usr/local

    Clone DeepaMehta 3 Git repository to your computer:
        git clone git://github.com/jri/deepamehta3.git

    A directory `deepamehta3` will be created. Go there:
        cd deepamehta3

2.  Upload DeepaMehta 3 to CouchDB:
        couchapp push --atomic http://localhost:5984/deepamehta3-db
